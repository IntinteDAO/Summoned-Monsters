Decks
=====

You can have up to 3 different decks in the game. Each deck has a special function.

- Main Deck is a deck that holds between 40 and 60 cards. It is from this deck that you draw the cards that you play during a match. All cards except Fusion are in this group. Remember to follow the banlist (this is done automatically in the computer game). You can have a maximum of 3 identical cards.

- Side Deck is a deck with 0 to 15 cards. It is used to modify other decks between matches. Be sure to follow the banlist (you cannot have more cards than the banlist indicates). You can have up to a maximum of 3 of the same card.

- Extra Deck / Fusion Deck is a deck that holds between 0 and 15 cards. It is used to separate the Fusion cards from the Main Deck.
