Phases
======

Our / opponent's turn consists of 6 game phases, which we will discuss. 

* **Draw Phase**, which is the phase of drawing a card. Immediately after drawing a card, you move on to the next phase.

* **Standby Phase**, which is the break phase. Some cards may activate their effects during this phase. You then move on to the next phase.

* **Main Phase 1** is the phase in which you have control of the playing field. During this phase you can summon monsters, activate spell cards or set traps.

* **Battle Phase** is the phase of battle. It is in this phase that the monster battles take place. During the battle phase you can use Quick-Play Spell cards, which are specially marked Spells and Trap cards (but only after waiting 1 turn). If the number of monsters on the field changes, you can cancel the monster attack. 

* **Main Phase 2** is the last phase, you can do the same as in Main Phase 1. You can summon the monster in Main Phase 2 if we did not do it in the previous Main Phase.

* **End Phase.** Some cards can activate their effects in this phase. Then you move on to the next turn.
