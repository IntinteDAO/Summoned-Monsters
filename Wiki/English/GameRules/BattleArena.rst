============

The Battle Arena of Summoned Monsters game consists of 8 elements which will be discussed here.

* **Main deck**, which is the deck from which we draw cards.

* **Extra / Fusion deck**, which is a deck specifically for fusion monsters.

* **Graveyard**, which is the place where destroyed monsters and spent spells / traps go by default. It differs from "Banned" in that some cards allow you to bring cards back into play from this place, such as Revival.

* **Banned**, cards from here are ultimately discarded during the match and cannot return to the playing field in any form.

* **Spell / Trap Zone** is where we use spells and traps.

* **Monster Card Zone** is where you summon monsters that take part in the battle.

* **Field Spell Zone** is where you activate spell cards that have the Field attribute.

* **Fusion Monster Card Zone** is a field that specializes in a Fusion Monster that has been summoned using a "Fusion" card.
