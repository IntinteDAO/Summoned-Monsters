Monster types

There are 6 types of monsters used in Summoned Monsters game.

- **Normal** are the simplest form of monsters. They have no Effect, but often have better stats than monsters with an Effect (as long as it is a positive effect).

- **Effect** is a group of monsters with effects that change abilities of monsters. Effects can be negative (then the monster has higher stats) or positive (lower stats).

- **Fusion** is a group of monsters that are summoned by combining specific monsters (called Fusion Materials) using a card (usually Fusion). Each fusion card has a description of what monsters are needed to summon them. Most Fusion monsters do not have descriptions. Fusion monsters do not use summoning limits.

- **Ritual** is a group of monsters that are summoned by using a special dedicated card (spell) and by sacrificing monsters from the field or hand of the same level as the ritual monster or more. Additionally, a ritual monster must be in your hand. Ritual monsters do not use the summoning limits.

- **Flip** is a subgroup of Effect monsters. It differs in that the effect only activates when the face-down card is flipped. This situation is most common when a monster is attacked or the owner flips a card from face-down to face-up position.

- **Toon** is a subgroup of Effect monsters. These are special monsters dedicated to use with Toon Story. Such monsters usually cannot attack in the first turn, but they can make a direct attack if the opponent does not have a Toon monster.
