# Summoned-Monsters

Summoned Monsters (OpenYGO) is a computer game created as a complement to the YGOPro engine.

Our goal is to create a free, independent and rule-based card game in which players fight against each other for victory using monster cards.

The game is inspired by the first generation of Yu-Gi-Oh!, which due to changes in the entertainment system is incompatible with the new generations of the game.

## Game status:

The previous version (github.com/fervi/openygo) is playable, but many cards are missing (we are going to have about 350 cards), network architecture (servers) and playable bots would be useful.

Currently the project will be rewritten (card generator) from Love2D (LUA) to PHP.
