# Summoned-Monsters

Summoned Monsters (OpenYGO) is a computer game created as a complement to the YGOPro engine.

Our goal is to create a free, independent and rule-based card game in which players fight against each other for victory using monster cards.

The game is inspired by the first generation of Yu-Gi-Oh!, which due to changes in the entertainment system is incompatible with the new generations of the game.

## Game status:

The game is in beta, mainly focused on improving card descriptions and developing the AI of the computer.
